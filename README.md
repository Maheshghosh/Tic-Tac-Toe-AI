TIC-TAC-TOE-AI
A Tic Tac Toe AI is a program designed to play the game of Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, against a human opponent or another AI. The goal of the AI is to make optimal moves to either win the game or, if winning is not possible, to avoid losing.

Here's a general description of how a Tic Tac Toe AI works:-

Game Representation:- The AI needs to represent the Tic Tac Toe game board internally. This is typically done using a data structure such as a 3x3 grid, with each cell representing an empty space, a nought, or a cross.

Game State Evaluation:- The AI evaluates the current state of the game to determine the best move. It considers factors such as the positions of noughts and crosses on the board and assesses the potential outcomes of different moves.

Move Execution:- Once the AI has determined the best move, it places its symbol (nought or cross) on the board in the appropriate position.

Opponent Response:- If playing against a human or another AI, the opponent makes their move, and the AI repeats the evaluation and decision-making process to determine its next move.

FAQ
How does the AI decide its moves in Tic Tac Toe?
Answer:- The AI typically uses algorithms like minimax, which evaluates all possible future moves and selects the one that leads to the best outcome (win, draw, or avoid loss). It may also employ techniques like alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency.

Can the AI be unbeatable in Tic Tac Toe?
Answer:-Yes, if implemented correctly, the AI can be programmed to play perfectly and achieve at least a draw in every game. However, achieving an unbeatable AI requires careful implementation of algorithms and strategies.

Is Tic Tac Toe AI only for playing against human opponents?
Answer:- No, Tic Tac Toe AI can also play against other AIs. In fact, many AI vs. AI competitions and simulations are conducted to evaluate and compare different AI algorithms and strategies.
